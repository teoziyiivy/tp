### Summary of Contributions

#### _New Feature_: Added `WeightTracker` class and weight commands/functions/responses.
* What it does: Handles weight commands from user allowing user to add, delete and list their weight. Also handling
the saving of weights to a `Weight.txt` file and loading of weights from the `Weight.txt` file.
* Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as users are able to track their 
weights which is important for our target users who need to closely monitor and control their weight.
* Highlights: This enhancement affected existing commands and commands to be added in the future. It required an 
in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation was challenging as well as it required changes to 
existing commands to ensure consistency between features despite taking in entirely different parameters which was 
`double` as compared to the existing features such as the `Fluid` and `Meal` classes which used `String`.
* Credits: Groupmates helped flesh out the ideas for `WeightTracker` class, standardising the user inputs and features.
