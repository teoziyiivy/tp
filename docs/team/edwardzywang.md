#### Enhancements implemented
* New feature implemented: Command Manager Class:
  * What it does: A class that makes sense of a user's inputs. 
  * Why is it needed: It is needed so that commands are all managed and split
  at a common starting point. This standardises the logic flow and also how we want the user's inputs to be formatted in. Reduces the load on all members when it comes to debugging as the same basic logic flows can be used and compared to
  quickly isolate bugs and resolve them.
  * What is noteworthy about it: Due to the numerous commands that CLI.ckFit supports, command manager is further split into different components,
  namely foodbank parser, command manager, list parser, add parser, delete parser, to manage different types of commands. This makes for a neater outlook 
  on our command manager class when it comes to reviewing, and also when users add new commands or functions of the same type, we can easily refer to 
  past or other similar commands to know what format of inputs or parameters should be accepted.

* New feature implemented: Miscellaneous classes like userHelp and contributions to Ui and Storage classes 
  * What it does: userHelp class handles the "help" command and has a unique output when invoked. memoryStartup method in Ui class takes in the user's input and when called, it loads all the information in the text 
    files as an array list by calling my methods in Storage class. My methods in Storage class then organises them in a reader-friendly 
    format, before printing the finished summary for the user to read.
  * Why is it needed: userHelp class is needed as the help commands calls for a unique output and can be called outside the main program memoryStartup method is needed as it is called outside the main program and accounts for the event when the user does
    not want to enter the main program to key in "list" command to see his past progress. It helps greatly in usability and convenience.
  * What is special about it:memoryStartup also offers the user the ability to clear the contents in the text files if the user wishes to start a
    new session, or if the user passes the program on to another user, and wishes to protect his privacy.

* New feature: Implemented BMI calculator in calculator class
  * What it does: A method which allows the user to calculate his or her BMI, so that the user
  can know whether he or she should concentrate on gaining or losing weight.
  * Why is it needed: It is needed to let the user know his or her starting point before using CLI.ckFit. It can also be accessed 
  without entering the main program, so it is useful for users who want to quickly check their BMI.
  * What is special about it: It works well with recommended daily caloric intake calculator to give the user an idea of where he 
  or she stands health-wise. Knowing their starting point helps a lot when it comes to how they use CLIck.Fit for their fitness and health 
  goals.
