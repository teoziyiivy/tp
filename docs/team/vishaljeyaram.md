## Overview
CLI.ckFit is a desktop-based fitness app which can be accessed easily via CLI. CLI.ckFit allows you to input your calories,
weight, foods, and workouts throughout the day. It also comes with a BMI and recommended caloric intake calculator
which can give you an idea of your current fitness level.

### Summary of Contributions

#### Enhancements implemented
* New Feature: Added ability to store meals and their associated calories in library
    * What it does: Users do not have to key in their calories when adding meals that have already been saved to their meal library.
    * The meal library automatically adds the calories associated to that meal from the meal library.
    * Justification: This feature ensures that users do not need to input calories for meals that they consume regularly, 
    * which may be difficult to remember. They only need to input the name of the meal and the meal library takes care of 
    * how many calories their meal contains, provided that they have added this particular meal and its calories to their 
    * meal library.
    * Highlights: When the user adds a meal without its calories, the meal library is checked. The name of the meal that the user
    * inputs is compared with the names of all the meals within the meal library. If the meal exists, the calories of that particular
    * meal will be returned. Else, an exception will be thrown. One challenge that was faced was ensuring that no duplicate meals were stored
    * in the meal library. Thus, when adding a meal to the meal library, the name of the meal added to compared with all existing 
    * meals within the meal library. Another challenge was ensuring that the user had input the meal with a description (name). Thus,
    * the "getDescription" method was called to obtain the description of the meal. The description was then checked for any separators. 
    * If it contained any separators, it was considered invalid, and an exception was thrown.

* New feature: The current date will be generated if the date has not been keyed in. 
    * What it does: Obtains user's system's date and uses this date if the user has not input a date for any of their
    * fitness parameters like adding their meals, fluids, weight or workouts.
    * Justification: When adding meals, fluids, weight or workouts, it is inconvenient for the user to type out the date 
    * for every single new input. Furthermore, if they do enter a wrong date by any chance, they will need to delete their
    * incorrect input. This wastes more time. Hence, in order to quicken the process, the current date will be input, saving 
    * the user time, if they do not manually input the date.
    * Highlights: The user input's is checked to see if the user has input a date separator. If not, the system date will 
    * be generated using the Java's "getSystemDate()" method. A challenge that was faced was also making sure 
    * that the date that was being generated was checked against, and added to the ArrayList of dates on which at least 
    * one fitness parameter was added. This ArrayList of dates was stored in the "DateTracker" class.

* New feature: Optional calculator calculates recommended caloric intake for the user.
    * What it does: Generates the ideal recommended caloric intake for users by taking in their activity level, sex, weight,
    * height, and age.
    * Justification: Users that are into pursuing fitness, especially those who are starting out, may need a rough gauge on 
    * how many calories they need to consume to maintain their body weight. This will also give them an idea of how many calories 
    * they will need to consume to either gain or lose weight. Thus, we can allow them to generate this ideal recommended 
    * caloric intake if they wish to, as it is an optional feature, everytime they launch the application.
    * Highlights: A series of questions will be asked, prompting the user to key in their age, height, weight, sex and 
    * activity level on a scale of 1 - 5. Once the user has input these parameters, the Harris-Benedict Formula is used to 
    * generate the user's ideal recommended caloric intake. A challenge faced was making sure that the 
    * user also knew what approach they needed to take ie. gain, lose or maintain their weight. Thus, this calculator was used 
    * in conjunction with the BMI calculator to give the user a clearer idea of what approach they need to take.
    * Credits: Harris-Benedict Equation was used. It is a method used to estimate an individual's basal metabolic rate (BMR).
